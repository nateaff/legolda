# Analysis files

These files contain the analysis code and write-up. All R code except for a few library calls and initial data loading calls are in the files in the `code` directory. 

# Files 
1. `tf-idf` Initial loading and munging of data. Computation and plots of TF-IDF and sample sets. 
2. `train-model.Rmd` Contains all model validation code and plots. Cross-validation of perplexity scores, scoring of models with `ldatuning` functions, coherence scores and plots of set distributions over topic probabilities. 
3. `compare-model-distributions.Rmd` Plots of color distributions over topics, plots of example sets and tables of example sets. 
4. `final-model.Rmd` Several plots of the final model. 
5. `background` Some math used in model evaluation.
